## 📌 Project: Blok

📝 **Description:** Blok is a new kind of backend development. Most backend frameworks focus on features. Blok focuses on clarity. It gives developers the power to build modular, testable, observable systems from the ground upwithout having to adopt complex orchestration platforms or serverless lock-in. As a Blok developer, you dont build backends by routing HTTP requests into controllers. You build workflows composed of focused nodes, observe them in real time, test each unit independently, and deploy them across runtimes or teams.

## 📌 Project: ideaVault

📝 **Description:** IdeaVault is a SaaS-based licensing platform that enables registration of original software project ideas. It operates under a modified MIT-style license which includes a binding attribution clause. Upon registration, verified unique ideas are granted protected status. Any developer using a registered idea in a commercial product must, under the license terms, remit 1% of gross revenue to the registered idea owner. This obligation is contractual and enforceable. IdeaVault does not confer ownership but facilitates limited rights and revenue-sharing tied to ideation, ensuring recognition and compensation for original contributors.
