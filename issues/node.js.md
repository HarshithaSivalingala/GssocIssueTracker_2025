## 📌 Project: Blok

📝 **Description:** Blok is a new kind of backend development. Most backend frameworks focus on features. Blok focuses on clarity. It gives developers the power to build modular, testable, observable systems from the ground upwithout having to adopt complex orchestration platforms or serverless lock-in. As a Blok developer, you dont build backends by routing HTTP requests into controllers. You build workflows composed of focused nodes, observe them in real time, test each unit independently, and deploy them across runtimes or teams.
