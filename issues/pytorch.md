## 📌 Project: Retail with purpose: Building a sustainable and responsible future

📝 **Description:** Sustainability is no longer an optionit a necessity. As consumers demand more eco-conscious choices, retailers must reimagine their operations to reduce waste, lower carbon footprints and create a more responsible supply chain. From sustainable sourcing and eco-friendly packaging to energy-efficient store designs and AI-driven waste reduction, innovation is transforming how businesses operate while ensuring long-term environmental and economic benefits.
 
 Walmart is at the forefront of this shift, leveraging AI to optimize supply chains and minimize waste. Their collaboration with GreenPod Labs is revolutionizing the way fresh produce is stored and transported, extending shelf life and significantly reducing food waste. These AI-powered strategies are ensuring fresher products, less spoilage and a more efficient distribution process, setting a new standard for sustainability in retail. Read more here.
 
 Beyond food sustainability, retailers are embracing circular economy models, closed-loop recycling systems and smart energy management to reduce emissions and drive impact at scale. The future of retail is not just about selling productsit about creating a positive, lasting impact on the planet and society.
 
 Think of solutions that retail businesses can leverage to push the boundaries of sustainability. Can your ideas lead to innovations in green logistics, zero-waste supply chains, ethical sourcing or carbon-neutral retail operations? Think beyond today solutions and help shape a smarter, greener and more responsible future for retail.

## 📌 Project: Used car price prediction

📝 **Description:** Developed a machine learning model to predict used car prices using Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression. Leveraged scikit-learn for model implementation and Matplotlib for data visualization. Analyzed the model's performance to improve prediction accuracy .The system utilizes Python with Pandas and NumPy for data processing, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning model training. It predicts car prices based on factors like brand, model, mileage, and year.
