## 📌 Project: eventmappr

📝 **Description:** 📌 Project Description – EventMappr
EventMappr is a community-focused web application that allows users to discover, add, and explore local events on an interactive map. Built using React JS and Leaflet.js, the app provides a simple and intuitive interface to visualize nearby happenings like music events, tech meetups, volunteering drives, art fairs, and more.

Users can pin new events on the map by submitting a short form and selecting a location. The app also features event filtering by category and a geolocation-based search to find events near the user's current location. With no backend dependencies, EventMappr runs entirely in the browser and is a perfect example of what can be achieved with modern frontend tools alone.

Ideal for communities, colleges, and local networks — EventMappr makes event discovery and sharing effortless.
