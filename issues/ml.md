## 📌 Project: payslip generation

📝 **Description:** My pay slip generation project is a web-based tool that helps companies create and manage employee salary slips easily. It allows HR or admin users to enter employee details like name, ID, salary, and deductions, and then automatically calculates the final salary and generates a downloadable pay slip in a proper format. The system is designed to save time, reduce manual errors, and ensure accurate salary documentation each month.
