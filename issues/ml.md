## 📌 Project: eventmappr

📝 **Description:** 📌 Project Description – EventMappr
EventMappr is a community-focused web application that allows users to discover, add, and explore local events on an interactive map. Built using React JS and Leaflet.js, the app provides a simple and intuitive interface to visualize nearby happenings like music events, tech meetups, volunteering drives, art fairs, and more.

Users can pin new events on the map by submitting a short form and selecting a location. The app also features event filtering by category and a geolocation-based search to find events near the user's current location. With no backend dependencies, EventMappr runs entirely in the browser and is a perfect example of what can be achieved with modern frontend tools alone.

Ideal for communities, colleges, and local networks — EventMappr makes event discovery and sharing effortless.

## 📌 Project: studymate

📝 **Description:** StudyMate is an open-source platform built to support college students during their semester exam preparations.

To address this issue, StudyMate offers a centralized and reliable hub where students can access syllabus content, previous year question papers (PYQs), peer-shared exam feedback, and seek guidance from seniors. By bringing all essential academic resources into one accessible platform, StudyMate aims to help students save time, study more effectively, and feel more confident during exams. Additionally, it provides a great opportunity for beginner-friendly contributors to collaborate and grow in the open-source community.
