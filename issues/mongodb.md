## 📌 Project: studymate

📝 **Description:** StudyMate is an open-source platform built to support college students during their semester exam preparations. The idea behind creating this platform originated from a common observation many students begin studying only when exams are near, often leading to confusion, stress, and wasted time searching for study materials. To address this issue, StudyMate offers a centralized and reliable hub where students can access syllabus content, previous year question papers (PYQs), peer-shared exam feedback, and seek guidance from seniors. By bringing all essential academic resources into one accessible platform, StudyMate aims to help students save time, study more effectively, and feel more confident during exams. Additionally, it provides a great opportunity for beginner-friendly contributors to collaborate and grow in the open-source community.

| Add Extended Profile Details | Medium | [#49](https://github.com/ThePlator/NPMChat/issues/49) |
| Add CAPTCHA Verification to Signup/Login

I'd love to contribute to your project by implementing a CAPTCHA verification system (like Google reCAPTCHA) on the signup/login page to help prevent bots or automated abuse.

Why is this needed?
- Improves security of the application  
- Helps reduce spam or fake account creation  
- A widely used UX-friendly solution for human verification

🔧 How I plan to implement:
- Use react-google-recaptcha for frontend CAPTCHA widget
- Validate token on backend using Google’s API
- Optionally display the CAPTCHA only after a few failed login attempts (if needed)

Please let me know if I can go ahead and work on this @Theplator
If this feature fits your roadmap, I’d be happy to raise a PR! 😊
