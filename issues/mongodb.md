## 📌 Project: ClassMgmtSys

📝 **Description:** Class Management System is a comprehensive MERN stack web application designed to streamline classroom operations and enhance communication between students, class representatives (CRs), class Advisors (CAs). Built with a decoupled architecture using Node.js/Express.js backend and React.js frontend, the system features Firebase authentication integrated with MongoDB for user management, providing role-based access control for different user types. The platform offers a centralized noticeboard for announcements, student roster management, subject-wise material uploads via Cloudinary integration, and planned features including voting systems, attendance tracking, push notifications, exam schedules, and event management. With Material-UI for consistent design, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline functionality, the system ensures a responsive, scalable, and user-friendly experience while maintaining security through Firebase token verification and data filtering via DTOs, making it an ideal solution for educational institutions seeking to digitize and organize their classroom management processes.
