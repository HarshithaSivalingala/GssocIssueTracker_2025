## 📌 Project: Airplane Boarding Simulation 

📝 **Description:** This project simulates the process of boarding passengers onto an airplane using various real-world boarding strategies such as back-to-front, random boarding, window-middle-aisle, and more. It visualizes how different strategies impact total boarding time and overall efficiency. Built entirely in Python using matplotlib, NumPy, and object-oriented design, the simulation is a great tool for analyzing time complexity, crowd dynamics, and real-life optimization scenarios.

The goal of the project is to make this simulation more interactive, modular, and extensible for educational, research, or visualization purposes.

## 📌 Project: Security Screening System 

📝 **Description:** A real-time security screening system, using face recognition with OpenCV. The system aims to scan individuals via a webcam at check-points (e.g., hotels, airports). If a person’s face matches an entry in the system’s dataset of known threats, runaway criminals or wanted individuals, the system triggers a threat alarm and sends an email alert to authorities immediately. Otherwise, a safe alarm is triggered, allowing them to proceed. The project aims to reduce manual intervention and automate security surveillance systems by enabling quick identification of flagged individuals.

## 📌 Project: Blok

📝 **Description:** Blok is a new kind of backend development. Most backend frameworks focus on features. Blok focuses on clarity. It gives developers the power to build modular, testable, observable systems from the ground upwithout having to adopt complex orchestration platforms or serverless lock-in. As a Blok developer, you dont build backends by routing HTTP requests into controllers. You build workflows composed of focused nodes, observe them in real time, test each unit independently, and deploy them across runtimes or teams.

## 📌 Project: Retail with purpose: Building a sustainable and responsible future

📝 **Description:** Sustainability is no longer an optionit a necessity. As consumers demand more eco-conscious choices, retailers must reimagine their operations to reduce waste, lower carbon footprints and create a more responsible supply chain. From sustainable sourcing and eco-friendly packaging to energy-efficient store designs and AI-driven waste reduction, innovation is transforming how businesses operate while ensuring long-term environmental and economic benefits.
 
 Walmart is at the forefront of this shift, leveraging AI to optimize supply chains and minimize waste. Their collaboration with GreenPod Labs is revolutionizing the way fresh produce is stored and transported, extending shelf life and significantly reducing food waste. These AI-powered strategies are ensuring fresher products, less spoilage and a more efficient distribution process, setting a new standard for sustainability in retail. Read more here.
 
 Beyond food sustainability, retailers are embracing circular economy models, closed-loop recycling systems and smart energy management to reduce emissions and drive impact at scale. The future of retail is not just about selling productsit about creating a positive, lasting impact on the planet and society.
 
 Think of solutions that retail businesses can leverage to push the boundaries of sustainability. Can your ideas lead to innovations in green logistics, zero-waste supply chains, ethical sourcing or carbon-neutral retail operations? Think beyond today solutions and help shape a smarter, greener and more responsible future for retail.

## 📌 Project: Voice Marketing Agents

📝 **Description:** OpenVoiceX is a powerful, open-source framework designed to help developers, businesses, and researchers build, deploy, and manage real-time voice-first AI systems. It brings together two complementary projectsOpenVoiceOS and Voice Marketing Agentsinto a single, unified platform. At its core, OpenVoiceX provides all the components you need to create sophisticated conversational assistants and AI-driven telephony agents. Whether it powering natural voice interactions on the web, automating phone calls for marketing and customer service, or experimenting with conversational AI research, OpenVoiceX gives you full controlwithout relying on expensive, proprietary APIs. The system is designed to be modular and extensible. You can integrate your preferred speech-to-text, large language models, and text-to-speech engines. Everything runs in a self-hosted, containerized environment using Docker, making it easy to deploy on your infrastructure and maintain full data ownership. A modern, web-based dashboard makes it possible to visually design, test, and manage your agents without writing code. For real-time voice interactions, OpenVoiceX achieves ultra-low latency pipelines, allowing conversations to flow naturallyeven with mid-sentence interruptions. It also supports traditional telephony services (like Twilio or Asterisk) and web-based voice clients out of the box. By combining a developer-first architecture with enterprise-grade features like multi-tenancy, encryption, and API key management, OpenVoiceX is not just a toolkitit a full-stack solution for building production-ready voice AI applications.
