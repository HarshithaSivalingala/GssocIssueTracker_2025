## 📌 Project: studymate

📝 **Description:** StudyMate is an open-source platform built to support college students during their semester exam preparations. The idea behind creating this platform originated from a common observation many students begin studying only when exams are near, often leading to confusion, stress, and wasted time searching for study materials. To address this issue, StudyMate offers a centralized and reliable hub where students can access syllabus content, previous year question papers (PYQs), peer-shared exam feedback, and seek guidance from seniors. By bringing all essential academic resources into one accessible platform, StudyMate aims to help students save time, study more effectively, and feel more confident during exams. Additionally, it provides a great opportunity for beginner-friendly contributors to collaborate and grow in the open-source community.
