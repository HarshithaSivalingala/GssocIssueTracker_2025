## 📌 Project: VisionMate

📝 **Description:** VisionMate is a smart assistive solution designed to support visually impaired people in navigating their surroundings more independently. It uses computer vision and speech technologies to identify objects, read text, and give real time voice feedback through a user friendly interface. I have uploaded the initial code and concept to GitHub to give an idea of the project’s vision, but not the full implementation yet. The project is currently in the development phase, with plans to expand its capabilities to include environment detection and safe navigation features.
