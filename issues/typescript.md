## 📌 Project: ideaVault

📝 **Description:** IdeaVault is a SaaS-based licensing platform that enables registration of original software project ideas. It operates under a modified MIT-style license which includes a binding attribution clause. Upon registration, verified unique ideas are granted protected status. Any developer using a registered idea in a commercial product must, under the license terms, remit 1% of gross revenue to the registered idea owner. This obligation is contractual and enforceable. IdeaVault does not confer ownership but facilitates limited rights and revenue-sharing tied to ideation, ensuring recognition and compensation for original contributors.
