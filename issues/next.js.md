| Add CAPTCHA Verification to Signup/Login

I'd love to contribute to your project by implementing a CAPTCHA verification system (like Google reCAPTCHA) on the signup/login page to help prevent bots or automated abuse.

Why is this needed?
- Improves security of the application  
- Helps reduce spam or fake account creation  
- A widely used UX-friendly solution for human verification

🔧 How I plan to implement:
- Use react-google-recaptcha for frontend CAPTCHA widget
- Validate token on backend using Google’s API
- Optionally display the CAPTCHA only after a few failed login attempts (if needed)

Please let me know if I can go ahead and work on this @Theplator
If this feature fits your roadmap, I’d be happy to raise a PR! 😊
