## 📌 Project: Voice Marketing Agents

📝 **Description:** OpenVoiceX is a powerful, open-source framework designed to help developers, businesses, and researchers build, deploy, and manage real-time voice-first AI systems. It brings together two complementary projectsOpenVoiceOS and Voice Marketing Agentsinto a single, unified platform. At its core, OpenVoiceX provides all the components you need to create sophisticated conversational assistants and AI-driven telephony agents.
