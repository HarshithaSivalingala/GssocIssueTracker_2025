Enhance typography for improved readability and consistency.

Introduce subtle visual enhancements (e.g., hover states, transitions) where appropriate.

Ensure full responsiveness across all screen sizes and devices.

Maintain consistency with the design of other pages.

## 📌 Project: Voice Marketing Agents

📝 **Description:** OpenVoiceX is a powerful, open-source framework designed to help developers, businesses, and researchers build, deploy, and manage real-time voice-first AI systems. It brings together two complementary projectsOpenVoiceOS and Voice Marketing Agentsinto a single, unified platform. At its core, OpenVoiceX provides all the components you need to create sophisticated conversational assistants and AI-driven telephony agents.
