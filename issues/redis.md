## 📌 Project: Retail with purpose: Building a sustainable and responsible future

📝 **Description:** Sustainability is no longer an optionit a necessity. As consumers demand more eco-conscious choices, retailers must reimagine their operations to reduce waste, lower carbon footprints and create a more responsible supply chain.

 Walmart is at the forefront of this shift, leveraging AI to optimize supply chains and minimize waste. Their collaboration with GreenPod Labs is revolutionizing the way fresh produce is stored and transported, extending shelf life and significantly reducing food waste. These AI-powered strategies are ensuring fresher products, less spoilage and a more efficient distribution process, setting a new standard for sustainability in retail. Read more here.
 
 Beyond food sustainability, retailers are embracing circular economy models, closed-loop recycling systems and smart energy management to reduce emissions and drive impact at scale.
