## 📌 Project: Zylar's World 

📝 **Description:** Zylar’s World is a 3D educational RPG that introduces players to philosophy through immersive﻿ gamification. Players take on the role of Zylar, an alien who escapes the monotony of its home﻿ world and crash-lands on Earth, only to be captured by humans for scientific study. Perceiving﻿ the humans as the true “aliens,” Zylar feels isolated and overwhelmed, eventually slipping into a﻿ deep slumber. Within this dream world, a mysterious alien goddess guides Zylar through five﻿ distinct philosophical eras—each presenting a unique challenge. As Zylar overcomes these﻿ trials, it gains insight into the human condition and the enduring questions of existence.
