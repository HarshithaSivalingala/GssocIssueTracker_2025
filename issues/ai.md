## 📌 Project: Zylar's World 

📝 **Description:** Zylar’s World is a 3D educational RPG that introduces players to philosophy through immersive﻿ gamification. Players take on the role of Zylar, an alien who escapes the monotony of its home﻿ world and crash-lands on Earth, only to be captured by humans for scientific study. Perceiving﻿ the humans as the true “aliens,” Zylar feels isolated and overwhelmed, eventually slipping into a﻿ deep slumber. Within this dream world, a mysterious alien goddess guides Zylar through five﻿ distinct philosophical eras—each presenting a unique challenge. As Zylar overcomes these﻿ trials, it gains insight into the human condition and the enduring questions of existence.

## 📌 Project: studymate

📝 **Description:** StudyMate is an open-source platform built to support college students during their semester exam preparations. The idea behind creating this platform originated from a common observation many students begin studying only when exams are near, often leading to confusion, stress, and wasted time searching for study materials. To address this issue, StudyMate offers a centralized and reliable hub where students can access syllabus content, previous year question papers (PYQs), peer-shared exam feedback, and seek guidance from seniors. By bringing all essential academic resources into one accessible platform, StudyMate aims to help students save time, study more effectively, and feel more confident during exams. Additionally, it provides a great opportunity for beginner-friendly contributors to collaborate and grow in the open-source community.
