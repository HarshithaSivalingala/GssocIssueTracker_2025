## 📌 Project: ClassMgmtSys

📝 **Description:** Class Management System is a comprehensive MERN stack web application designed to streamline classroom operations and enhance communication between students, class representatives (CRs), class Advisors (CAs). Built with a decoupled architecture using Node.js/Express.js backend and React.js frontend, the system features Firebase authentication integrated with MongoDB for user management, providing role-based access control for different user types.

With Material-UI for consistent design, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities for offline functionality, the system ensures a responsive, scalable, and user-friendly experience while maintaining security through Firebase token verification and data filtering via DTOs, making it an ideal solution for educational institutions seeking to digitize and organize their classroom management processes.

## 📌 Project: ideaVault

📝 **Description:** IdeaVault is a SaaS-based licensing platform that enables registration of original software project ideas. It operates under a modified MIT-style license which includes a binding attribution clause. Upon registration, verified unique ideas are granted protected status. Any developer using a registered idea in a commercial product must, under the license terms, remit 1% of gross revenue to the registered idea owner. This obligation is contractual and enforceable. IdeaVault does not confer ownership but facilitates limited rights and revenue-sharing tied to ideation, ensuring recognition and compensation for original contributors.
