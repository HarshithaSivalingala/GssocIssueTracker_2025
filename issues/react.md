| Issue: UI Enhancement – About Page


Description:

The current design of the About page requires UI refinement to align with the overall visual identity of the platform. The layout, typography, and responsiveness can be improved to deliver a more polished and user-friendly experience.

Objectives:

Refactor the layout for better structure, spacing, and visual hierarchy.

Enhance typography for improved readability and consistency.

Introduce subtle visual enhancements (e.g., hover states, transitions) where appropriate.

Ensure full responsiveness across all screen sizes and devices.

Maintain consistency with the design of other pages.
